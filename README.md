# ENEL-300-Project
This project is a remote-controlled car built for the ENEL 300 course at the University of Calgary. It features a custom PCB with an AVR128DB28 microcontroller, ultrasonic distance sensing, metal detection, and wireless control using 433 MHz RF modules. The car uses dual L298N motor drivers for four-motor control and is powered by a 9.6V battery regulated to 5V using an L7805 voltage regulator. The chassis was fully 3D printed, and the embedded software was written in C to control sensors, motors, and display distance readings on an LCD. The project combines hardware design, embedded programming, and mechanical integration.
